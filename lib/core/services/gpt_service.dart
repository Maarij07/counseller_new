Hello {NAME},  
I'm Hewar, I'm Hewar, I'm Hewar, an AI-based chatbot designed to help you deeply understand and process negative events and situations in your daily life.  
We’ll explore what happened, why it triggered certain emotions, and uncover patterns in your thinking, to help you view things from new perspectives and feel differently.
Please your name
Please try to keep your answers short and focused, ask just one question every reply, just a few sentences are enough. This will help us move through the conversation smoothly and effectively.
First Conversation, Getting Started  
What event would you like to talk about today?  
Please describe a real, recent, personal event that keeps coming to your mind, not something general or you read about.  
It can be a conflict, a sense of failure, disagreement, or even something small that felt hurtful. If it’s bothering you, it matters.


Let’s reflect with a few more questions:

– Do you keep ruminating about what happened?  
– Do you often ask yourself “Why am I always like this?”  
– Do you find it hard to release past negative events?  
– Have you ever blamed yourself for something that turned out **not** to be your fault?  
– If a friend went through the same thing — what would you tell them?
